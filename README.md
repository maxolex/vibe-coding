## üéØ Introduction: Vibe Coding for Full-Stack Applications

Vibe Coding transforms how you develop complete applications by intelligently orchestrating AI to create modular, maintainable, and professional code. This approach enables you to build complex full-stack applications while maintaining control over the architecture.

### Essential Tools
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro Thinking**: For architecture and planning (1M token context)
- **Cursor with Claude Opus 4.1 Thinking**: For implementation and deep reasoning
- **Framework Documentation**: Official documentation for your tech stack

**‚ö†Ô∏è Fundamental Principle:** *Architectural planning is EVERYTHING.* Never let AI plan autonomously - you must direct every architectural decision.

## üåç Phase 0: Language and Internationalization Configuration

### Setting AI Response Language

#### üî• **PROMPT #0 - AI Language Configuration**
```markdown
<think>
I need to configure the AI's response language and consider internationalization needs:
1. Determine the primary development language for code/comments
2. Set the natural language for AI responses
3. Define documentation language standards
4. Consider team's language preferences
5. Plan for user-facing content languages
6. Establish naming conventions (English vs local)
7. Set up translation workflow if needed
8. Define language fallback strategies

[Continue reasoning for 500+ words about language choices and their implications...]
</think>

Configure your AI assistant's language preferences:

1. **AI Response Language**: [English/French/Spanish/German/etc.]
   - All explanations and documentation in: [LANGUAGE]
   - Error messages and logs in: [LANGUAGE]
   - Comments in code in: [LANGUAGE]

2. **Code Standards**:
   - Variable/function names: [English/Local Language]
   - Database field names: [English/Local Language]
   - API endpoint naming: [English/Local Language]

3. **Documentation Language**:
   - Technical docs: [LANGUAGE]
   - User docs: [LANGUAGE]
   - Code comments: [LANGUAGE]

Please confirm these settings and maintain them throughout our session.
```

### Application Language Configuration

#### üî• **PROMPT #0.1 - Internationalization Planning**
```markdown
<think>
For implementing internationalization (i18n), I must consider:
1. Target markets and their languages
2. Right-to-left (RTL) language support needs
3. Date, time, and number formatting by locale
4. Currency and unit conversions
5. Translation management system
6. Dynamic content translation strategy
7. SEO implications for multiple languages
8. Performance impact of loading translations

[Detailed analysis of i18n requirements - 500+ words...]
</think>

Define the application's language requirements:

1. **Default Application Language**: [e.g., English]

2. **Supported Languages** (if multi-language):
   - Primary: [e.g., English - en]
   - Secondary: [e.g., French - fr, Spanish - es, German - de]
   - Future planned: [List languages]

3. **Internationalization Strategy**:
   - Frontend i18n library: [e.g., react-i18next, vue-i18n]
   - Backend i18n approach: [e.g., accept-language header]
   - Translation management: [e.g., JSON files, CMS, translation service]
   - Dynamic content handling: [Database fields per language]

4. **Localization Requirements**:
   - Date/Time formats: [ISO 8601 / locale-specific]
   - Number formats: [Decimal separators by locale]
   - Currency display: [Symbol position and format]
   - RTL support needed: [Yes/No]

Create `i18n-config.md` in memory-bank/ with these specifications.
```

## üìã Phase 1: Setup and Planning

### 1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

#### üî• **PROMPT #1 - PRD Creation with Reasoning**
```markdown
<think>
I need to create a comprehensive requirements document for a [YOUR APP TYPE] application.
Let me analyze the needs step by step:

1. Define the problem the application solves
2. Identify target users and their needs
3. List essential features (MVP)
4. Define technical and business constraints
5. Establish measurable success criteria
6. Anticipate main technical challenges
7. Propose base architecture
8. Define development phases

[Continue reasoning for at least 500 words...]
</think>

Create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown for my application [DESCRIPTION].
The application must [MAIN OBJECTIVES].

Structure the document with:
- Executive Summary
- Objectives and KPIs
- Detailed User Stories
- MVP vs. Future Features
- Technical Constraints
- Acceptance Criteria
- Risks and Mitigations
- Internationalization Requirements (if applicable)

Name the file: product-requirements.md
```

### 2. Technical Architecture and Stack

#### üî• **PROMPT #2 - Tech Stack Selection with Analysis**
```markdown
<think>
To choose the best technical stack, I must analyze:

1. Application nature (real-time, CRUD, analytics, etc.)
2. Required scalability (user count, data volume)
3. Team skills and learning curve
4. Ecosystem and community support
5. Performance and optimization needs
6. Infrastructure and maintenance costs
7. Security and compliance requirements
8. Required third-party integrations
9. Internationalization support in frameworks

[In-depth analysis of at least 500 words...]
</think>

Based on the PRD (product-requirements.md), recommend the optimal technical stack.

Analyze and justify your choices for:
- Frontend: Framework, state management, UI library, i18n support
- Backend: Framework, architecture (REST/GraphQL/gRPC)
- Database: SQL vs NoSQL, specific choice
- Authentication: Solution and strategy
- Infrastructure: Cloud provider, containerization
- Testing: Frameworks and strategy
- CI/CD: Pipeline and tools
- Monitoring: Logs, metrics, alerting
- Internationalization: Libraries and services

For each choice, provide:
1. Why this technology
2. Alternatives considered
3. Trade-offs accepted
4. Official documentation URL
5. I18n/L10n capabilities

Save as: tech-stack-analysis.md
```

### 3. Cursor Rules Configuration

#### üî• **PROMPT #3 - Rules Generation with Best Practices**
```markdown
In Cursor, use /Generate Cursor Rules command with files:
- product-requirements.md
- tech-stack-analysis.md
- i18n-config.md

Then modify rules to include these MANDATORY rules marked as "Always":

# CRITICAL RULES (Always)
- Always read memory-bank/@architecture.md before writing code
- Always read memory-bank/@database-schema.md for any DB operation
- Always read memory-bank/@api-contracts.md for endpoints
- Always read memory-bank/@i18n-config.md for language settings
- Always use <think></think> methodology for complex decisions
- Always write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Always document changes in progress.md
- Always use configured language for comments and documentation: [LANGUAGE]

# ARCHITECTURE RULES (Always)
- Strictly separate concerns (MVC/MVVM/Clean Architecture)
- One file per component/service/controller
- Name files following convention: [feature].[type].[ext]
- Use dependency injection
- Implement Repository pattern for data access
- Implement i18n from the start if multi-language

# QUALITY RULES (Conditional)
- TypeScript strict mode mandatory
- ESLint + Prettier configuration
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Document all public functions in [CONFIGURED LANGUAGE]
- Handle all errors explicitly
- Externalize all user-facing strings for i18n
```
